## What is BeastieBot?
BeastieBot is an ongoing, open source, chat bot project. He is designed to be used in Twitch chat rooms and (soon to be implemented) Discord servers, and was created to be a customizable live streaming tool and online community moderator. His primary features include:

* Automated Twitch raid system w/ rewards
* Commands for community social links
* Automated Twitch host 'thank you' message
* Automated Twitch follow 'welcome' message
* Timers for chat rules, community quotes, and reminders

A full list of BeastieBot's current features can be found here: [Feature List](../master/FeatureList.md)

BeastieBot is an ongoing community project, and we are always interested in new ideas, features and developers interested in helping us train Beastie to be even more awesome!

## Can I use BeastieBot?
Yes! BeastieBot is an open source project free for anyone to use. Once you have downloaded the bot/cloned this repo, installation instructions can be found here: [Installation Instructions](../master/InstallationInstructions.md)

## Can I contribute to the BeastieBot project?
Yes! Anyone can contribute to the BeastieBot project. For project updates and discussion, we suggest that you join the teamTALIMA [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/dGFQ5tE "teamTALIMA's Discord Server") or try to catch a teamTALIMA [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/teamtalima "teamTALIMA's Twitch Channel") (where we develop the project live), but neither is strictly necessary.

We encourage anyone interested in learning more about chat bot development to ‘Watch’ this project on GitHub and join the teamTALIMA community! Everyone from hobbyists to students to professionals to experts are welcome in here. We have many teammates within our community who mentor and do their best to answer questions and share knowledge about their development fields and areas of experience.

## This is Awesome! How do I contribute?
All contributions should be made through this repo. Create a ‘Pull Request’ with your contribution and description of contribution, and it will be reviewed by one of our project managers! Pull requests should contain as few changes as possible (only those necessary to implement the single, new feature the pull request is contributing) in order to avoid conflicts when merging into the project.

> *Note:* Most pull requests will need to be critiqued/revised slightly to merge with the project properly. This is standard. Do not be discouraged if your contribution is not accepted immediately.

You will also need to be sure that you have installed BeastieBot correctly, as well as all of his developer dependencies. Check [Installation Instructions](../master/InstallationInstructions.md) for more information.

Depending on the type of contribution, here are some guidelines to follow so your PR has the best chance of being merged:

### Programming
When contributing new code or code updates, each pull request should only deal with one feature/bug fix. Be as focused with your changes as is reasonable, so the project code and your code will run into as few merge conflicts as possible.

Since this is a community project, code commenting is important to us. Any code which falls around an intermediate or higher tutorial level, needs to be commented. Use your best judgement.

In the description, state the new feature/bug fix to be implemented, and then describe your new code clearly and concisely.

Bonus points to contributors who take the time to match their code style to the project’s code style, so Project Managers do not have to focus on code maintenance/consistency :)

### Testing
Interested in testing BeastieBot in an effort to improve the project? Please submit any bugs you find as an Issue. 

Each bug should be represented as an individual Issue, and should contain details on the bug itself, where to find the bug, and ESPECIALLY how to replicate it.

### New Feature Ideas
Currently, all ‘ideas’ for BeastieBot should be submitted as an Issue with the label ‘idea’ attached to it. Any ideas or suggestions for new features or improvements to the development process are always welcome!
